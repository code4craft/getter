A tool for manage text in alias for shell. 

### About

Written in two language with little difference:

#### Python

[https://github.com/code4craft/getter/tree/master/python](https://github.com/code4craft/getter/tree/master/python)

Save all text and alias in ~/.getrc. No command complement.

#### Shell

[https://github.com/code4craft/getter/tree/master/shell](https://github.com/code4craft/getter/tree/master/shell)

Save each alias-text pair in /usr/local/getter/ as a file with -alias as filename. This file is executable so you can call it directly with command complement.
